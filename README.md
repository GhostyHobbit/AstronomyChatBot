## Intended Use
This bot is aimed for people who want to aimlessly talk about weird space facts and fool around with an AI chat bot just to see what it can do. The bot is specialized in astronomy, Kepler planets, black holes and time theories. 
### Functionalities
**JWST Info:** The bot has access to a report of the plans for the build and launch of the James Webb Space telescope. Ask anything related to the JWST and the bot will answer in great detail.  
**Images:** It's capable of giving you the APOD (Astronomy Picture of the Day) starting from 1995-06-16. Just ask the bot for a picture by mentioning a date formatted in YYYY-MM-DD and it will show you the image together with the official NASA explanation of the image. These images and exlplanations are pulled straight out of the APOD API.
## Issues
**JWST Info:** Even though the information the bot will give from the report is entirely accurate, it is an outdated report from 2009. If you ask the bot when the JWST was launched (December 25th 2021) it will tell you the launch is scheduled to happen on December 18th 2021. Take the JWST information as outdated and not entirely accurate to the information we have access to nowadays.  
**Images:** The bot is only able to read dates formatted as YYYY-MM-DD. These instructions also show on the page itelf.
